I am a postdoctoral fellow at National Institutes of Health. I work on application of machine learning and high-performance computing in the field of Biophysics. I did my Phd at Johns Hopkins University - School of Medicine and was lucky to be advised by Dr. Tom Woolf. Prior to that, I did my undegraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.
